    "### Vanishing Gradient Problem and Exploding Gradient Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "When training deep neural networks, two common issues arise: the **vanishing gradient problem** and the **exploding gradient problem**. These issues affect the stability and efficiency of training, particularly in very deep networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. **Vanishing Gradient Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is it?**\n",
    "- The gradients (partial derivatives of the loss with respect to weights) become **very small** as they are propagated back through the network.\n",
    "- This causes earlier layers (closer to the input) to learn very slowly or not at all, as their weights are updated minimally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Causes**\n",
    "- **Activation functions:** Functions like sigmoid and tanh squash input values to a small range:\n",
    "  - Sigmoid: \\( (0, 1) \\)\n",
    "  - Tanh: \\( (-1, 1) \\)\n",
    "  - Their gradients become very small for inputs far from 0.\n",
    "- **Chain rule in backpropagation:** Gradients are multiplied across layers during backpropagation. If these gradients are small, their product approaches zero:\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  (0.1)^{50} \\approx 1 \\times 10^{-50}\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "- **Deep architectures:** The deeper the network, the more layers the gradients must traverse, amplifying the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. **Exploding Gradient Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is it?**\n",
    "- Gradients become **very large** as they are propagated back through the network. This leads to unstable updates of model weights, sometimes causing numerical instability or divergence during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Causes**\n",
    "- **Large weights:** Poor weight initialization can cause activations and gradients to grow exponentially.\n",
    "- **Chain rule in backpropagation:** Gradients are multiplied across layers. If these gradients are large (e.g., \\( > 1 \\)), their product grows exponentially:\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  (10)^{50} \\approx 1 \\times 10^{50}\n",

    "## 3. **Solutions**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **For Vanishing Gradients**\n",
    "1. **Use ReLU or its Variants:**\n",
    "   - ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) avoids vanishing gradients because:\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     \\text{ReLU}(x) = \\max(0, x)\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "     Gradients do not saturate for positive inputs.\n",
    "   - Variants: Leaky ReLU, Parametric ReLU, and GELU.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Batch Normalization:**\n",
    "   - Normalizes inputs to each layer, ensuring stable gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Weight Initialization Techniques:**\n",
    "   - **Xavier Initialization:** Maintains variance of activations across layers.\n",
    "   - **He Initialization:** Optimized for ReLU activations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Residual Connections (ResNets):**\n",
    "   - Skip connections allow gradients to flow directly, bypassing vanishing effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Gradient Clipping:**\n",
    "   - Clip gradients to a range (e.g., \\( [-1, 1] \\)) to prevent excessively small values.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **For Exploding Gradients**\n",
    "1. **Gradient Clipping:**\n",
    "   - During backpropagation, clip gradient values to a maximum threshold:\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     \\text{if } \\|\\nabla w\\| > \\text{threshold}, \\quad \\nabla w = \\frac{\\nabla w}{\\|\\nabla w\\|} \\times \\text{threshold}\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Weight Initialization Techniques:**\n",
    "   - Use Xavier or He initialization to prevent excessively large weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Careful Learning Rate Selection:**\n",
    "   - Use smaller learning rates to prevent large weight updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Use of Normalization Layers:**\n",
    "   - Batch Normalization and Layer Normalization help control gradient magnitudes.\n",
